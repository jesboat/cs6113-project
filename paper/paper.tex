\abstract
Abstract goes here, summarize what this paper covers and what we ended up with.

\section{Introduction}
Introduce idea and outline what it will require us to do.  Explain where we're
starting from (Pottier and Simonet) at a high level.  Justify why this is an
interesting problem that needs tackling.

\section{Operational Semantics}
Outline the operational semantics of the baby language we developed.  Outline
any interesting similarities or differences between us and Pottier and Simonet.

\section{Type System}
Outline the type system of the language and again compare/contrast with
Pottier and Simonet.

\section{Proofs}

I'm imagining this section could outline the human version of the proofs we'd
need to do a full noninterference proof.

\section{Mechanizing Proofs}

Talk about what did/should have been mechanized.  Talk about troubles and/or
interesting bits here.  Might point out here that we're fairly certain that we
found an inaccuracy in the original paper.

\section{Related Work}

Discuss various references related to our project.

\section{Future Work}
Talk about stuff we still have to do for this to be a complete project.  Talk
about expected problems and required techniques.  Talk about what we could do
once this project is completed and we could use it for other projects.

\section{Conclusion}
Summarize again what we covered, where we ended up, and where we'd like to go
next.
